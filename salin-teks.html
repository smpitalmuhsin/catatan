    <textarea readonly onclick="this.select()">Zoom in tightly on the Logitech
M650L, focusing on the scroll wheel and the curvature around the thumb rest. The frame should include only a portion of the mouse - extreme close-up. Use the uploaded product image exactly as it is - do not change or stylize any part of the mouse, including shape, logo, text, material, or color. All details must remain 100% realistic and untouched. The intent is to highlight the tactile experience and refined material quality.

Use a soft key light from the top-left to create gentle specular highlights on the scroll wheel texture. Capture the subtle transition between matte and semi-gloss surfaces of the mouse body, especially around the sculpted lines. Shadows should fall smoothly into the backdrop, allowing the texture and finish of the plastic and rubber to speak.

The background can be a deep desaturated neutral like slate grey or charcoal, defocused with light falloff toward the edges.

This is a micro-level ad shot - meant for carousel middle slides, or to showcase engineering and tactile build quality.
