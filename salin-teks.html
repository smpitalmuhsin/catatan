    <textarea readonly onclick="this.select()">Zoom in tightly on the shoe, focusing on the stitching detail along the upper and the curvature of the heel or arch support. The frame should include only a portion of the shoe – extreme close-up. Use the uploaded product image exactly as it is – do not change or stylize any part of the shoe, including shape, logo, text, material, or color. All details must remain 100% realistic and untouched. The intent is to highlight the tactile experience, stitching craftsmanship, and refined material quality.

Use a soft key light from the top-left to create gentle specular highlights on textured surfaces like leather, knit, or rubber. Capture the subtle transitions between matte fabric, semi-gloss accents, or mesh areas, especially around stitched lines or panel overlaps. Shadows should fall smoothly into the backdrop, allowing the material character and finish to speak.

The background can be a deep desaturated neutral like slate grey or charcoal, defocused with light falloff toward the edges.

This is a micro-level ad shot – meant for carousel middle slides, or to showcase craftsmanship, texture depth, and high-quality material finish.
